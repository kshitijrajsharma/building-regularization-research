One very important task in applications like urban planning and reconstruction is to automatically extract building footprints. The integration of different information, which is presently achievable due to the availability of high-resolution remote sensing data sources, makes it possible to improve the quality of the extracted building outlines. Recently, deep neural networks were extended from image-level to pixel-level labelling, allowing to densely predict semantic labels. Based on these advances, we propose an end-to-end U-shaped neural network, which efficiently merges depth and spectral information within two parallel networks combined at the late stage for binary building mask generation. Moreover, as satellites usually provide high-resolution panchromatic images, but only low-resolution multi-spectral images, we tackle this issue by using a residual neural network block. It fuses those images with different spatial resolution at the early stage, before passing the fused information to the Unet stream, responsible for processing spectral information. In a parallel stream, a stereo digital surface model (DSM) is also processed by the Unet. Additionally, we demonstrate that our method generalizes for use in cities which are not included in the training data.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Nowadays, deep learning allows to automatically learn features from data. Buildings are one of the most important objects in urban environments. They are used in applications such as inputs to building reconstruction, disaster monitoring, city planing and environment modelling for autonomous driving. However, it is not enough to represent them in raster format, since applications require buildings as polygons. We use an existing, learning based approach to extract building footprints from ortho imagery and digital surface model (DSM) and propose a pipeline for building polygon extraction, which we call primary orientation learning (POL). The first step is to extract initial polygons, that contain a vertex for each pixel in the boundary of the footprint. Afterwards, the two primary orientation angles are regressed continuously. Using these orientation, we insert vertices such that all consecutive edges are perpendicular. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to predict a continuous orientation angle for building boundary regularization. Furthermore, the proposed method is highly efficient with an average processing time of 2.879 ms for a single building.\n                    </jats:p>",
