One very important task in applications like urban planning and reconstruction is to automatically extract building footprints. The integration of different information, which is presently achievable due to the availability of high-resolution remote sensing data sources, makes it possible to improve the quality of the extracted building outlines. Recently, deep neural networks were extended from image-level to pixel-level labelling, allowing to densely predict semantic labels. Based on these advances, we propose an end-to-end U-shaped neural network, which efficiently merges depth and spectral information within two parallel networks combined at the late stage for binary building mask generation. Moreover, as satellites usually provide high-resolution panchromatic images, but only low-resolution multi-spectral images, we tackle this issue by using a residual neural network block. It fuses those images with different spatial resolution at the early stage, before passing the fused information to the Unet stream, responsible for processing spectral information. In a parallel stream, a stereo digital surface model (DSM) is also processed by the Unet. Additionally, we demonstrate that our method generalizes for use in cities which are not included in the training data.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Accurate and reliable building footprint maps are of great interest in many applications, e.g., urban monitoring, 3D building modeling, and geographical database updating. When compared to traditional methods, the deep-learning-based semantic segmentation networks have largely boosted the performance of building footprint generation. However, they still are not capable of delineating structured building footprints. Most existing studies dealing with this issue are based on two steps, which regularize building boundaries after the semantic segmentation networks are implemented, making the whole pipeline inefficient. To address this, we propose an end-to-end network for the building footprint generation with boundary regularization, which is termed RegGAN. Our method is based on a generative adversarial network (GAN). Specifically, a multiscale discriminator is proposed to distinguish the input between false and true, and a generator is utilized to learn from the discriminator’s response to generate more realistic building footprints. We propose to incorporate regularized loss in the objective function of RegGAN, in order to further enhance sharp building boundaries. The proposed method is evaluated on two datasets with varying spatial resolutions: the INRIA dataset (30 cm/pixel) and the ISPRS dataset (5 cm/pixel). Experimental results show that RegGAN is able to well preserve regular shapes and sharp building boundaries, which outperforms other competitors.</jats:p>",

At each iteration, the vertices of the polygon are displaced based on the local value of a 2D shift map that is inferred from the input image via an encoder-decoder architecture. The main training loss that is used is the difference between the polygon shape and the ground truth segmentation mask. The network employs a neural renderer to create the polygon from its vertices, making the process fully differentiable. We demonstrate that our method outperforms the state of the art segmentation networks and deep active contour solutions in a variety of benchmarks, including medical imaging and aerial images.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Nowadays, deep learning allows to automatically learn features from data. Buildings are one of the most important objects in urban environments. They are used in applications such as inputs to building reconstruction, disaster monitoring, city planing and environment modelling for autonomous driving. However, it is not enough to represent them in raster format, since applications require buildings as polygons. We use an existing, learning based approach to extract building footprints from ortho imagery and digital surface model (DSM) and propose a pipeline for building polygon extraction, which we call primary orientation learning (POL). The first step is to extract initial polygons, that contain a vertex for each pixel in the boundary of the footprint. Afterwards, the two primary orientation angles are regressed continuously. Using these orientation, we insert vertices such that all consecutive edges are perpendicular. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to predict a continuous orientation angle for building boundary regularization. Furthermore, the proposed method is highly efficient with an average processing time of 2.879 ms for a single building.\n                    </jats:p>",

Their automatic reconstruction, e.g. from airborne laser scanning data, as regularized shapes is therefore of high relevance. Today’s airborne laser scanning technology can produce dense 3D point clouds with high accuracy, which makes it an eligible data source to reconstruct 2D building outlines or even 3D building models. In this paper, we propose an automatic building outline extraction and regularization method that implements a trade-off between enforcing strict shape restriction and allowing flexible angles using an energy minimization approach. The proposed procedure can be summarized for each building as follows: (1) an initial building outline is created from a given set of building points with the alpha shape algorithm; (2) a Hough transform is used to determine the main directions of the building and to extract line segments which are oriented accordingly; (3) the alpha shape boundary points are then repositioned to both follow these segments, but also to respect their original location, favoring long line segments and certain angles. The energy function that guides this trade-off is evaluated with the Viterbi algorithm.\n                    </jats:p>",
