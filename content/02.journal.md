Geographic information systems (GIS) and cartographic applications typically require building footprints as
precise vector polygons, rather than raster masks [@url:https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/html/Zorzi_PolyWorld_Polygonal_Building_Extraction_With_Graph_Neural_Networks_in_Satellite_CVPR_2022_paper.html#:~:text=While%20most%20state,and%20polygonal%20angle%20difference%20loss]. Building footprint regularization refers to the process
of refining raw building outlines (e.g. from remotely sensed imagery or LiDAR) into clean polygon shapes that conform to
expected geometric constraints (such as orthogonal corners or aligned edges). The goal is to eliminate
irregular artifacts (noisy jags, misalignments) while preserving the true shape, so that the footprints are
cartographically suitable for maps
In many cases, regularization assumes buildings are rectilinear structures with predominantly 90Â° corners : an assumption that, while not universally true, holds for
most residential and industrial buildings. This review traces the evolution of footprint regularization
methods from early vectorization algorithms in the 1990s through modern deep learning approaches in the
2020s.

We focus on 2D footprint outline techniques (planimetric building outlines) and exclude full 3D
building reconstruction or roof modeling. Key developments and representative methods are discussed for
each era, highlighting their algorithms, use cases, strengths, and limitations. We then compare traditional
versus deep learning-based methods in terms of performance, flexibility, accuracy, and integration into GIS
workflows. The review draws on peer-reviewed research and real-world implementations (including open-
source tools and commercial pipelines) to provide a comprehensive perspective for remote sensing and GIS
professionals.
